## Thesis Projects

This repository contains the main projects developed for the thesis titled **"Optimization and complexity analysis of asset allocations under different social welfare conditions"**.

These projects represent the core developments carried out during the thesis research. Other projects and algorithms developed subsequently were based on the foundations established here.

## Directory Structure

- **`Negociaciones_bajo_egalitarian_social_welfare/`**: Contains projects related to negotiation problems under egalitarian social welfare conditions. It includes implementations using both LLGA (Linear Linkage Genetic Algorithm) and ULGA (Unrestricted Linkage Genetic Algorithm).
    - `LLGA/`: Implementation using LLGA.
    - `ULGA/`: Implementation using ULGA.
- **`Reparto_de_recursos_bajo_egalitarian_social_welfare/`**: Contains projects focused on resource allocation problems under egalitarian social welfare conditions. It explores different variations and algorithms:
    - `LLGA/`: Implementation using LLGA.
    - `LLGA_aplicando_normal/`: LLGA implementation incorporating a normal distribution approach.
    - `ULGA/`: Implementation using ULGA.

Each project directory typically contains the source code (`src/`), compiled binaries (`bin/`), and specific documentation (`README.md`).
